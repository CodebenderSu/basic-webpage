# Basic Webpage

## About:
This webpage was made for a project for a Udacity Intro to Programming class. The project specifications required a basic webpage built with HTML and CSS. Beyond that, it could be a webpage featuring anything. I decided to just make a gallery page of Minecraft builds I had made as I couldn't think of anything else to make a page about. I also included Bootstrap in this project for additional practice and for responsive layout.

## Dependencies:
This webpage only has a dependency on Bootstrap.
* Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/
